  	"description": "Unsigned Studio worked with Marine Traffic AIS to visualise their global shipping data set. Sampling over 15 million data points. We created custom software to process and manage the data and ultimately produce a film showcasing their data in a way it had not been realised before.",

  	"body": "After receiving raw data drops, we ran them through a custom application which performed some initial preprocessing. We then ingested the data into our backend. Now that the data could be handled efficiently, we wrote a series of scripts which talked to our backend, analysed and compiled the data into code our rendering software which we used to create the animation.",
