  "description": "Every year Squint/Opera Melbourne produces a large amount of data. Squint/Opera by the Numbers began in 2015 as means to get a grip on the data created in the studio. Two years in, we can compare the size of data on a project by project basis, average file size and the number of files generated. Although the data nebula is more abstract, real world utility and insights have been drawn from it. \n\nThe visualisation runs on iOS and Android devices along with a desktop app. At any given time up to 20mil points are rendered on screen.",
