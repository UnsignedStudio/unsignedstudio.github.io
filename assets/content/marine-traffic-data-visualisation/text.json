	"description": "Unsigned Studio worked with Marine Traffic AIS to visualise their global shipping data set. Sampling over 15 million data points. We created custom software to process and manage the data and ultimately produce a film showcasing their data in a way that had not been realised before.",

Now that the data could be handled efficiently, we wrote a series of scripts which talked to our backend, analysed and compiled the data into code our rendering software used to create the animation.",
