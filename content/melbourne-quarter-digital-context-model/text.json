  "description": "To present a future development site in its Melbourne CBD setting, we developed a digital context model.\n\nA scale model of Melbourneâ€™s ground plane formed the physical base for multiple and interactive layers of site and context information. The complete installation included precision CNC machined acrylic models, solid clear 3d printed models, large commercial displays, custom hardware, new display software and an iPad application for control and user input.",
